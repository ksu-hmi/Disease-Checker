# Disease-Checker 

 You have a sick feeling when you start your day, but you cannot tell if it is a cold or flu, fever, or something more serious. Is there a simple tool that could let you check your symptoms against a library of diseases and offer smart suggestions for what to do next? This is the inspiration behind our project: The Intelligent Disease Symptoms Checker (IDSC)
